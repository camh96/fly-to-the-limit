                <p class="desc">Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries Vokalia and Consonantia, there live the blind texts. Separated they live in Bookmarksgrove right at the coast of the Semantics, a large language ocean. A small river named Duden flows by their place and supplies it with the necessary regelialia. 
                    <br />It is a paradisematic country, in which roasted parts of sentences fly into your mouth. Even the all-powerful Pointing has no control about the blind texts it is an almost unorthographic life.

        <div class="questions">
        <div id="q1">
        <h4 class="questions">What are the safety precautions for skydiving?</h4>
        <p class="questions">The requirements are fairly simple, you cannot have alcohol in your system, and should be free of any illnesses. We also ask if you are pregnant, have heart or back problems, or have had surgery recently that you reconsider skydiving with us. If you have been SCUBA diving within the past 24 hours, we ask you do not skydive with us due to the risk of decompression sickness. This is where nitrogen bubbles form in the bloodstream and cause symptoms from a rash and aches, to in more severe cases paralysis and death.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="q2">
        <h4 class="questions">Where can I go?</h4>
        <p class="questions">Anywhere listed on our <a href="services.html">services </a>page</p>
        </div>
        <div id="q3">
        <h4 class="questions">Can I have a discount?</h4>
        <p class="questions">Ha. No.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="q4">
        <h4 class="questions">How much time should I allow for a scenic flight?</h4>
        <p class="questions">About half an hour longer than your flight is schduled for. This allows time for flight and safety checks, aswell as breifings and any trivial delays.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="q5">
        <h4 class="questions">Is there a minimum age for skydiving?</h4>
        <p class="questions">Not really, but children under 12 need to be fitted with a harness and anyone under 18 needs a parent/legal guardian to sign a legal consent form</p>
        </div>
        <div id="q6">
        <h4 class="questions">How do I get to the airstrip? Can you take me there?</h4>
        <p class="questions">Our airstrip is in Wanaka, and yes, we have a compilmentary shuttle to pick you up from the door of your place of accommodation.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="q7">
        <h4 class="questions">What are your opening hours?</h4>
        <p class="questions">The phone lines are open from 6:30am to 10pm on weekdays and 8:00am to 7:30pm on weekends. You can jump any time during daylight. We can also do dawn/dusk skydivines at request.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="q8">
        <h4 class="questions">How do I book?</h4>
        <p class="questions">You can go to the <a href="contact.html">contact us</a> page, phone us on 0800 10 11 12 or drop in anytime.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="q9">
        <h4 class="questions">What payment methods do you accept?</h4>
        <p class="questions">We have a secure payment system online with DPS, we accept credit card online, and we have EFTPOS terminals onsite that accept Diners, AMEX, Visa, MasterCard and Discover. Obviously, we also accept cash. Please note on all credit card transactions there is a 1.5% processing fee. Please be aware if you do not hold a New Zealand Credit Card, you may be liable to a currency conversion fee with your local bank back home.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="q10">
        <h4 class="questions">What if it is raining on the scheduled day?</h4>
        <p class="questions">We will not jump if the weather is bad. If you are scheduled for a scenic flight, you will be able to take a later flight, either that day or tomorrow. No refunds are given, this is why we ask that you are flexible with time and dates.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="q11">
        <h4 class="questions">I'm not jumping but can i come up just for the ride?</h4>
        <p class="questions">No. For safety reasons, everyone in the plane <em>must</em> wear a parachute, even the pilot. If you slip, or get knocked off balance once the door is open, you will probably fall to your death. Everyone must jump.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="q12">
        <h4 class="questions">What happens if i get up there and wimp out?</h4>
        <p class="questions">This is exceptionally rare, but if it happens, you and your instructor will come back with the plane. No refunds are given.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="q13">
        <h4 class="questions">Can I jump from higher than the maximum altidtude?</h4>
        <p class="questions">No, what kind of a question is that? The limit is set at 15,000 ft max height by the CAA, so we'd be breaking the law. Not to mention it's also dangerous.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="q14">
        <h4 class="questions">How long is the freefall?</h4>
        <p class="questions">From 15,000ft (4,575 metres) – 60 seconds, and from 12,000ft (3,650 metres) – 45 seconds</p>
        </div>
        <div id="q15">
        <h4 class="questions">Has anyone ever been hurt?</h4>
        <p class="questions">Not in our short time operating.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="q16">
        <h4 class="questions">What if both the main and reserve parachute fail to open?</h4>
        <p class="questions">In the super unfortunate and ulikely case <em>both</em> chutes dont open, you have about 20 seconds to live before you both become part of the ground. Impacting the ground at terminal velocity never ends well.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="q17">
        <h4 class="questions">Question still not here?</h4>
        <p class="questions">Give us a buzz on 0800 10 11 12, or hit us up on our <a href="contact.html">contact us</a> page </p>
