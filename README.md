Client
-------------

The client is Fly to the Limit NZ, which is a startup company that offers flight experiences to customers in Queenstown. They do skydiving, transport flights, glider flights, and sight seeing flights.

> **Requirements:**

> - The site must be able to accept online bookings. If the booking is for a transport flight, dates and destination must also be entered.
> - They want a photo gallery with images they will provide.
> - Every plane is owner operated, and kept in top condition, exceeding minimum safety requirements as set by Civil Aviation Law.

There are currently 4 fixed wing aircraft, 1 glider and  1 helicopter.

Company is owned by husband and wife team, Olga and Bruce McKenzie. Both born in Southland and have 19 and 9 years experience with commercial airlines in the middle east. 

> **SAFETY WARNING:**

> - If you are pregnant, have heart or back problems, or have had surgery recently, we strongly recommend you reconsider skydiving with us. Instead maybe go on a scenic flight.
> - Stay close to your instructor at **ALL** times, and follow all crew instructions.
> - We recommend you have no alcohol or drugs in your system at the time you skydive. If you do, it may impair your ability to think and react quickly, which while unlikely, can be fatal.
> - If you have been SCUBA diving within the past 24 hours, we ask you do not skydive with us due to the risk of decompression sickness. This is where nitrogen bubbles form in the bloodstream and cause symptoms from a rash and aches, to in more severe cases paralysis and death.

#### Staff

Stunt pilot for th red arrows, served in combat choppers. Owns an EXTRA EA-200 for the ultimate full stunt flight experience.

**Wendy "Dropper" Gilhallen**

Commercial pilot for 13 year in Africa, Russia and South America. Has survived more than 3 plane crashes, which she claims none of which were her fault. Owns a Cessna-172 Skyhawk P. This plane is ideal for low level sightseeing.

**John "Doc" Holliday**

With over 10,000 hours flying helicopters in the bush and mountains of the Southern Alps for deer recovery under his belt, Doc is well qualified to land you and your friends in the remote parts of New Zealand. He will help map your route according to his Meteorological and Geographic knowledge, drop you off and pick you up when he's done.

**Hans Gerhansen**

Known how to fly since he was a kid. Took the controls of a small plane when he was 12 and first flew solo at 14. He settled into a few test pilot jobs out of high school, but later left those as he prefers to have company when in the sky. Owns a microlight, but you'll see him at the controls of any of our crew's plane. When he's not skiing, tramping, hang gliding or climbing, you will find him playing with his band at the local hotel.
